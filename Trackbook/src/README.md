# Introduction

The RusTracker project is a web software using public Automatic Dependant Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data to track flights. Informations such as speed, location or model can be find in ADS-B data [^note]. The goals of the project are to detect and receive those data, then to create an utilisator interface. On that interface, the user could see planes in real time , in antenna range. He could also oberserve the plane trajectory and know the flight informations(speed, high, engine).


This markdown book serves as project report. You can find the source code on the three on the different GitHubs:
* [RusTracker]() for the treatment of data.
* [Trackui]() for the graphic interface.
* [Trackbook]() for the Rust Programming Language book.





[^note]: ADS-B data is public, every aircrafts in the world are required to have a transponder.
